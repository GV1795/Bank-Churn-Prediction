# Bank-Churn-Prediction
In this project, we aim to build a robust Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for a given dataset.
We'll delve into key data preprocessing steps, including Data Encoding to convert categorical variables, 
Feature Scaling for normalization, and addressing Imbalanced Data issues. Our focus is on optimizing the SVM model through Grid Search for Hyperparameter tuning, ensuring the best performance. Throughout this journey, we'll provide a comprehensive understanding of each concept, empowering you to navigate the intricacies of data preprocessing and model optimization.
